# Binary-Tree
The main objective of this lab is to understand and implement the basic operations on a Binary Search Tree (BST). These operations include insertion, deletion, finding the minimum and maximum elements, and performing tree traversals (preorder, inorder, and postorder). By the end of this lab, you will be able to manipulate and traverse a binary search tree effectively.
